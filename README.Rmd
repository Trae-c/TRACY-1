##Hello Octocat

I love Octocat. She's the coolest cat in town.

## Assignment 2
```{r quick_look, echo=TRUE}
data("anscombe")
dim.data.frame(anscombe)
colnames(anscombe)
head(anscombe)
tail(anscombe)
summary(anscombe)

```
## Assignment 3

```{r xy_plot, echo=FALSE, fig.height=8, fig.width=8, fig.align='center', dev='svg', fig.path='./figures/'}
data("anscombe")
anscombe
with(anscombe, plot(x1, y1))
abline(lm(y1 ~ x1, data = anscombe))
```
## Assignment 4

```{r data_import, echo=TRUE}

library(readr)
df <- read_csv("analgesic.csv")

```
```{r data_summary, echo=TRUE}
dim.data.frame(df)
colnames(df)
head(df)
tail(df)
summary(df)
```
```{r data_tidy, echo=TRUE}
library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)
library(forcats)

altered_df <- df  %>%
# Tidy up df data from wide to long format  
  gather(key = Measurements, 
         value = Results, 
         Measurement_1:Measurement_3) %>%
  # Now set grouping factor
  group_by(Measurements) %>%
  # Summarize the data based on mean value across measurements on each individual  
  summarise( Mean = mean(Results)) %>%
  # Ungroup to remove current grouping to allow for future data analysis 
  ungroup()
  # print out final data frame 
  altered_df

```
## Assignment 5

## Chicken Weights

```{r chicken weights, echo=TRUE}
## Null Hypothesis
# H0: The chick weights are not dependent on the type of feed.

## Alternative hypothesis
# H1: The chick weights are dependent on the type of feed.

# Import data
library(readr)
chicken <- read_csv("chick-weights.csv")

# Tidy data from long to wide format
boxplot(weight~feed, data=chicken)

# Statistical test: One-way ANOVA
chicktest <- aov(weight~feed, data = chicken)
summary(chicktest)

## Test statistic
# The grouping factor has more than three levels.

# Degree of freedom
Df= 5

# p-value
p< 0.05

## Outcome of analysis
# The null hypothesis is rejected therefore the chick weights are dependent on the chick feed. 
```
## The Hot Zone

```{r the hot zone, echo=TRUE}
## Null Hypothesis
# H0: The contaminated water does not cause gastroenteritis.

## Alternative hypothesis
# H1: The contaminated water causes gastroenteritis.

# Import data
library(knitr)
GIT <- read_csv("gastroenteritis.csv")

# Tidy data using scatterplot
Graph1 <- xtabs(~Consumption + Outcome, data = GIT)
Graph1

# Plot barplot
barplot(Graph1, beside = TRUE, ylab = 'Consumption', xlab = 'Outcome' , main = 'Gastroenteritis', col= c('red','grey','black'))
legend('top', c('<1 glasses/day', '1 to 4 glasses/day', '>4 glasses/day'), fill = c('red','grey',' black'))

# Statistical test:Chi-square test
z <- chisq.test(Graph1, correct = TRUE)
z

## Test statistic
# Analyse 2 categorical data.
# To determine whether there is an association between two variables.

# Degree of freedom
Df= 2

# p-value
p< 0.05

## Outcome of analysis
# The null hypothesis is rejected therefore consuming contaminated water cause gastroenteritis.

```
## Nausea

```{r Nausea, echo= TRUE}
## Null Hypothesis
# H0: The 5HT3-receptor blocker treatment does not reduce nausea.

## Alternative hypothesis
# H1: The 5HT3-receptor blocker treatment does reduce nausea.

# Import data
library(readr)
Nausea <- read_csv("nausea.csv")

# Tidy data: the numeric rating scale is anchored at 0 (no nausea) to 6 (severe nausea and vomiting) for the rate of nausea intensity. Therefore remove row 9 (patient 8).

# Plot
plot(Nausea$Nausea_before ~ Nausea$Patient, type = "l", ylim = c(0, 6), xlab = "Patient", ylab = "Nausea_score", main = " Intensity of their nausea before and after receiving a 5HT3-receptor blocker", col = "blue", lwd = 2) 
lines(Nausea$Nausea_after ~ Nausea$Patient, col = "red", lwd = 2)
legend("top", c("Nausea_before","Nausea_after"), fill = c("blue", "red"))

# Statistical test
wilcox.test(Nausea$Nausea_before,Nausea$Nausea_after, paired = TRUE)

## Test statistic
# The test analyses two variables that are paired and non-parametric in one population group in order to determine the association between them.

# p-value
p=0.05

## Outcome of analysis
# The null hypothesis is rejected therefore 5HT3-receptor blocker reduces nausea.

```
## Assignment 6

## Housing prices

```{r Housing prices, echo=TRUE}
## Null Hypothesis
# H0: The housing prices do not depend on the interest rates.

## Alternative hypothesis
# H1: The housing prices do depend on the interest rates.

# Import data
library(readr)
Houses <- read_csv("housing-prices.csv")

# Tidy data
Interest = Houses$interest_rate
House_price= Houses$median_house_price_USD
head(cbind(Interest,House_price))

# Plot
plot(Interest,House_price, xlab = "interest_rate", ylab = "median_house_price_USD")
abline (lm(Houses$median_house_price_USD ~ Houses$interest_rate, data = Houses), col="red", lwd=2)

# Statistical test:Pearson Linear Regression

# Linear regression
House1 <- lm(Houses$median_house_price_USD ~ Houses$interest_rate, data = Houses)
summary(House1)

# Diagnostic test 1:Homoskedasticity
plot(x=House1$fitted.values, y=House1$residuals, main = "Homoskedasticity", col="green", lwd=2)
abline(h=0, col="red", lwd=2)

# Diagnostic test 2: QQ plot
qqnorm(House1$residuals)
qqline(House1$residuals)

# Binary outcome variable
glm(Houses$median_house_price_USD ~ Houses$interest_rate, data = Houses)

## Test statistic
# I plotted a scatter plot to check for linear relationship and outliers.
# The linear diagnostic tests were used to detremine whether: there was a linear trend, the residuals were normally distributed and the residuals have the same variance for all fitted values of y.

# Degree of freedom
Df= 15

# p-value
p< 0.02

## Outcome of analysis
# The null hypothesis is rejected therefore housing prices are dependent on the interest rate.
